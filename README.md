Randomized password generator Challenge Week 3
Didn't do a lot of commits, kept working on and off on it with my desktop on. I have to be better at committing regularly.
It took me a while to debug one nasty mistake, I hadn't declared password as an array, and the push functions kept bugging.
I also had to lookup how to change my resulting array into a string.
I realized at the 11th hour that this gives a random code with random characters out of what the user choices CAN be there, but doesn't force at least one of each selection in the final password.
